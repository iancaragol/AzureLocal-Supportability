Troubleshoot Template
- Focus on providing systematic troubleshooting guidance for specific issues
- Replace all {placeholders} with relevant content
- This template provides a suggested structure - adapt sections as needed for your specific issue
- Skip optional sections if they don't add value

Styling
- Images should be placed in the `./images` folder and referenced
- Any code block should be wrapped in triple backticks (```) with language identifier
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps and bullet points for symptoms/options

Coding Standards
- All code snippets MUST be safe to execute in a production environment
- Check that the environment is in the expected state before performing mitigation

You can use this regex to find placeholders that need to be replaced (search by Regex in your editor): \{([^}]+)\}
