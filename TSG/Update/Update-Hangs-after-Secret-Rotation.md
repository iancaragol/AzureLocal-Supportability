# Description
After Secret Rotation Update will stall and the HCI Orchestration service is crashing about every minute.

# Symptoms
During Update the progress will stall after secret rotation.

# Issue Validation
1. Update has not made progress after Secret Rotation
   * Update is usually trying to update the Lifecycle Agents which is the step after secret rotation.
2. ECE Service (HCI Orchestrator) is crashing.

You can use the following Cmdlet to check to see if the service is crashing. Just paste the script into the PowerShell window and run ```Get-OrchestrationLastCrash```.

### Script
```PowerShell
Function Get-OrchestrationLastCrash {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string]$Executable = "HciOrchestratorService.WinSvcHost.exe"
    )
    
    # We want to check all nodes
    # Get the node that Orchestration Service is running on
    $node = (Get-ClusterGroup *Orc*).OwnerNode

    # Just grab the exceptions from that node
    $error_messages = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $node -ScriptBlock {
        $startTime = (Get-Date).AddHours(-1)
        Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName = "Application"; StartTime = $($startTime); ID = 1000 } -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    } 

    $sorted_error_messages = $error_messages | Sort-Object TimeCreated -Descending
    $orchestation_errors = $sorted_error_messages | Where-Object { $_.Message -match $Executable }
    $last_error = $orchestation_errors | Select-Object -First 1 | Select-Object -Property TimeCreated, MachineName, Message
    $last_error | Format-List * -Force
}
```

Once you run the cmdlet if you see the following event this TSG you should see the following stack trace containing MtlsCertificateException.

```
TimeCreated : SomeDate
MachineName : TheMachineName

```


# Cause
There are two possible known causes, either the root certificate is missing on a node or a service/script is calling Orchestration Service with an old client certificate.

# Mitigation Details

There are multiple mitigations, start from the first and stop when you see the issue go away. Usually Orchestration service crashes once every 1 minute or so, so make sure to wait a little before checking by using ```Get-OrchestrationLastCrash``` and checking that the TimeCreated value is after the running the mitigation.

## **(No Production Impact)** Terminate Start-MonitoringActionplanInstanceToComplete

As state above this cmdlet has an issue with handling secret rotation. If someone is using the cmdlet, just cancel and reload it.

## **(No Production Impact)** Restart LCM Extension on all Nodes

We have found that LCM Controller will continue to use a certificate after we have performed secret rotation. This will restart LCM Controller on the node in which it is running. Paste the following script them run ```Restart-LCM```.

```powershell
Function Restart-LCM {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()

    $nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name

    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $nodes -ScriptBlock {
        Write-Host "[$env:COMPUTERNAME]: Getting LCMController service"
        $service = Get-Service 'LcmController' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        
        if ($service -and ($service.Status -eq 'Running')) {
            Write-Host "[$env:COMPUTERNAME]: Restaring LCMController"

            $service | Stop-Service -Force
            $service | Start-Service
            
            Write-Host "[$env:COMPUTERNAME]: LCMController Restarted"
        }
        else {
            Write-Host "[$env:COMPUTERNAME]: LCMController is not running."
        }

    }
}
```

## Ensure Root Certificates are installed on all Nodes

This script will ensure that the root certificates are correctly installed on all nodes. Once you paste the script you can run in the same window as many times as you want by running ```Import-AzureLocalRoots```.

### Script

```powershell
Function Import-AzureLocalRoots {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()

    # Get the list of nodes to install the roots on
    $nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name

    # This installs the Service and PKU2U roots to the root store. In 
    # addition, we have to install the PKU2U root to the Local Cert 
    # Issuer store in order for PKU2U to work. If the certificate is 
    # already installed windows will not install a duplicate.
    [scriptblock]$scriptBlock = {
        $serviceRootPath = "C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\AzureStackCertificateAuthority\AzureStackCertificationAuthority.cer"
        $pku2uRootPath = "C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\AzureStackCertificateAuthority\AzureStackCertificationAuthorityPKU2U.cer"

        if (!(Test-Path $serviceRootPath)) {
            throw "Missing Service Root Certificate in Share! Path: '$($serviceRootPath)'"
        }

        if (!(Test-Path $pku2uRootPath)) {
            throw "Missing PKU2U Root Certificate in Share! Path: '$($pku2uRootPath)'"
        }

        Function Test-ForRoot {
            [CmdletBinding()]
            param(
                [string]$Path,
                [string]$Store
            )
            [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]$rootPft = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]::new($Path)
            $checkStoreForPfx = Get-ChildItem "$Store\$($rootPft.Thumbprint)" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

            if ($checkStoreForPfx) {
                Write-Host "`t`t'Certificate already installed with thumbprint '$($rootPft.Thumbprint)'"
            }
            else {
                Write-Host "`t`t'Installing certificate with thumbprint '$($rootPft.Thumbprint)'"
                Import-Certificate `
                    -CertStoreLocation $Store `
                    -FilePath $Path | Out-Null
            }
            Write-Host " "
        }

        Write-Host "`tAttempting to Install AzureStackCertificationAuthority to Root Store"
        Test-ForRoot -Path $serviceRootPath -Store "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root"

        Write-Host "`tAttempting to Install AzureStackCertificationAuthorityPKU2U to Root Store"
        Test-ForRoot -Path $pku2uRootPath -Store "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root"

        Write-Host "`tAttempting to Install AzureStackCertificationAuthorityPKU2U to Local Cert Issuer Store"
        Test-ForRoot -Path $pku2uRootPath -Store "Cert:\LocalMachine\Local Cert Issuer\"
    };

    # This ensures that messages do not overlap
    foreach ($node in $nodes) {
        Write-Host "Installing Roots on '$node'"
        Invoke-Command `
            -ComputerName $node `
            -ScriptBlock $scriptBlock
        Write-Host " "
    }
}
```

## **(No Production Impact)** Restart all local Azure Local Services and Move all Clustered HCI Services

This script moves all Azure Local Clustered Services to a new node and then restarts all local Azure Local services. The output is somewhat verbose, but it indicates when all services are being moved or restarted.

Once you paste the Cmdlet you can run it by calling ```Restart-AzureLocalServices```.

### Script
```powershell

<#
    Restarts all windows services, move the cluster grouped services to other nodes.
#>
Function Restart-AzureLocalServices {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()

    Function Write-Local($Message) {
        Write-Host "[$($env:COMPUTERNAME)] : $Message"
    }

    $nodes = (Get-ClusterNode).Name

    # Single Node Cluster
    if ($nodes.Length -eq 1)
    {
        $services = @(
            'Azure Stack HCI Download Standalone Tool Agent',
            'ECEAgent',
            'URP Windows Service Service',
            )
        return;
    }


    # This will move the cluster service to another node.
    Function Move-ClusterService($Name) {

        if ($nodes.Length -eq 1)
        {
            $Name = $Name.Replace(" Cluster Group", "")
            Write-Local "Single Node Cluster, restarting '$Name' service"
            $service = Get-Service 
            $service | Stop-Service | Out-Null
            $service | Start-Service | Out-Null

            return;
        }

        $group = Get-ClusterGroup $Name
        $sourceNode = $group.OwnerNode
        [string[]]$targetNodes = ($nodes | Where-Object { !$_.Equals($sourceNode) })
        $targetNode = $targetNodes[0]

        Write-Local "Moving Cluster Group '$Name' from '$($sourceNode)' to '$($targetNode)'"
        Move-ClusterGroup -Name $Name -Node $targetNode
    }

    Move-ClusterService "Azure Stack HCI Orchestrator Service Cluster Group"
    Move-ClusterService "Azure Stack HCI Update Service Cluster Group"
    Move-ClusterService "Azure Stack HCI Download Service Cluster Group"
    Move-ClusterService "Azure Stack HCI Health Service Cluster Group"

    # This restarts the Azure Local non clustered services
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $nodes -ScriptBlock {
        $services = @('Azure Stack HCI Download Standalone Tool Agent', 'ECEAgent')
        foreach ($service in $services)
        {
            Write-Host "[$env:COMPUTERNAME] Restart $service"
            $service = Get-Service $service
            $service | Stop-Service -Force
            $service | Start-Service
        }
    }
}
```
